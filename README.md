# Draw On Pages

Use your stylus, and draw over any web page content. The drawn content is
anchored with the text which is under it.

## Description

This is a Firefox addon which will overlay, when enabled, the largest scrollable
area with a transparent drawable surface.

This surface area can then be painted with variable width stroke using a stylus
pressure.

The paintable surface is anchored on the content that it overlays. This implies
that any drawing will scroll with the page that it overlays.

The paint/navigation mode can be toggled on/off, which let you access elements
of the content for following links, or interacting with the web site.

## Features
 - Stylus Pressure: When drawing, the added 'ink' will change width based on the pressure of a stylus.
 - Scrollable: Objects which are drawn will follow the overlayed content.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
 - Ctrl-Z : Undo the last paint action.
 - Ctrl-Shift-Z : Redo the last undo-s actions.
 - Ctrl-X : Toggle between navigation and Draw mode.
